# Qlikview Enhanced User Control

The main purpose of this app is to allow QV administrators to manage user access more easily.

For example:
* adding/removing multiple users to multiple documents at the same time. 
* preview which users to which documents are assigned in single sortable table (answer the questions that im asked very often: 
"Is X can access A,B and C document?" or "Which users can access A document?"
* view all active documents in single table (useful when there is cluster environment)

v.0.4.0 (29/06/2015)
* bug fixes
* Copy users from one doc to another (with option to append)

To be added:
~~* Copy users from one doc to another (with option to append)~~ (added in v0.4.0)
* Clear user from document(s)
* During the server issue we've lost all users<->doc link. At the moment the app can only export this list and the users 
can be added manually. In the next release there will be an option to import these backups
